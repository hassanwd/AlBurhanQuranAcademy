// `mongoose` is registered in `serverExternalPackages` (next.config.ts), so it's loaded
// through Node's persistent module cache instead of webpack. That means `mongoose.models`
// survives Next.js dev-server hot reloads across file edits. With the old
// `models.Enrollment || model(...)` guard, once a model was compiled once, later schema
// edits (like adding the new enrollment fields) kept being ignored — the stale, previously
// compiled model was always returned, so the extra fields were silently stripped on save
// and never reached MongoDB or the admin dashboard.
// Deleting any previously compiled model before recompiling guarantees the schema
// currently on disk is always the one mongoose uses, in dev and prod alike.
